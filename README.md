## Blocks is a globally encrypted file sharing platform

## Introduction

Users can upload files/images to Blocks with peace of mind that your sensitive data will soon be secure, uncensorable and shareable. Security in Blocks comes from the decentralized process through the Ethereum Blockchain. Through this process, your files will be safely stored in the IPFS (The InterPlanetary File System) utilizing Solidity Smart Contracts, into a unique hash password that can be shared via text, email or even by QR CODE.
